# Accessibility-GDPR-Notes
Some notes on best practices for crucial dev practices.

## GPPR
`tl;dr`
Mostly on the frontend the primary concerns are about providing a modal to make folks aware of data tracking with an option to opt out, as well as being judicious with organizing and securing any data retention, log-ins and saved info and what not needs to be organized and the access control should be documented and secrue.

## Accesibility

The biggest takeaways on accesibility:
* learn to use a screen reader and use it on a regular basis, I think there is probably some SEO understandings embedded in embracing this practice. Crawling pages in this way has the potential to emphasize the underlying hierarchy and structure.
* Make things semantic and not overly complex. 
  * Exciting styling is great, but content is always first and foremost.
  * Make a logical flow of Headers and utilizing appropriate tags.
